# Lightweight tracking software for analyzing behavior of Single adult Zebrafish 

- Can also be used for larvae but need to ensure better lighting conditions and clear separation between fish and background

## Experimental setup for ideal results
- Tank with good illumination and clear separation between fish and background
- Camera should cover the entire tank and if possible use a ND/ polarizing filter to reduce glare and reflections
- Ideally camera should be at-least 1080p 60fps but we can work with lower resolutions namely 720p 30fps
- Fix the camera strongly so that it doesn't shake during recording and ensure no moving objects within frame other than fish
